This was a project I was asked to do as part of an interview.

The following are the tasks and my self-evaluation:

- Create the Database as follows:
  - Category table with fields:
    - ID
    - Title
  - Post table with fields:
    - ID
    - Title
    - Category (FK to Category.ID)
    - Publication Date
    - Content

- Create Categories and Posts page as follows:
  - This is the Index page of the project and everything works.
  - Error handling is not complete.

- Create Add Category page as follows:
  - Title input has focus.
  - Save button is functional.
  - Redirect is functional.
  - Error handling is not complete.
    - No validation to ensure uniqueness.
    - No null Title check.

- Create Edit Category page as follows:
  - Title input has focus.
  - Title input contains the [Current Value] selected by the user.
  - Save button is functional.
  - Redirect is functional.
  - Error handling is not complete.
      - No validation to ensure uniqueness.
      - No null Title check.

- Create Add Post page as follows:

  - Save button is functional.
  - Redirect is functional.

- REST API

  - I look forward to learning more about APIs.
